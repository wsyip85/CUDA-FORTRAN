# CUDA-FORTRAN
My code for learning CUDA-FORTRAN and applying it in GOOGLE-COLABS free GPU. My quest is to master CUDA-FORTRAN. 
To run, just upload the Jupyter Notebook file to your Google Colab (colab.research.google.com). 
Then, upload the .cuf files to your Google Drive (drive.google.com). 
If your upload to the appropriate directory defined in the Jupyter Notebook, all is good. 
Enable GPU in your Google Colab and mount your Google Drive. 
You should be able to run the Jupyter Notebook file.
